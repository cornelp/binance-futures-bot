# Tehnical
- logic will be responsable of taking all the important decisions
    - it will be helped by a strategy instance

- we start by adding the exchange info on the selected coin
- we start a strategy, we collect previous prices for a specified interval, we calculate RSI on it (inside the strategy instance)

# Logic
- checks for price failure
- once the price has fallen and we have signs of rising up, buy position (usually 10x)
- wait for it to grow, and then setup stop loss, with green values, if it we're to fall again
- on 30% of profit or something, close position to take profit
